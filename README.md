# An Explainable AI Decision Support System for Mitotic Detection using B-cos Networks

## Abstract
Mitotic count is a critical prognostic factor in breast cancer grading (Nottingham Grading System). However, manual counting is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability.

This project introduces a Transparent Decision Support System that automates mitotic figure detection while prioritizing clinical trust. Unlike standard "Black Box" AI, our system uses B-cos Networks to provide "faithful-by-design" pixel-level explanations for every prediction.

## Key Features
* Scalable Detection (Stage 1): Utilizes YOLOv11L integrated with SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) to detect small mitotic figures in high-resolution Whole Slide Images (WSIs) without downsampling artifacts.
* Interpretable Classification (Stage 2): A B-cos ResNet50 classifier that distinguishes mitotic cells from mimics (e.g., apoptotic bodies) with 94% Precision.
* Faithful Explainability: Generates high-fidelity saliency maps directly from the model's forward pass, avoiding the inaccuracies of post-hoc methods like Grad-CAM.
* Smart Focus Visualization: A novel clinical visualization tool that uses saliency maps as alpha masks to blur background noise and spotlight diagnostic chromatin features.

## Tech Stack
* Deep Learning: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv11
* Data Processing: NumPy, Pillow, SAHI
* Backend: FastAPI (Python)
* Frontend: Next.js (React)
* Visualization: Matplotlib
* Hardware: Optimized for NVIDIA T4 GPU

## Pipeline Overview
1. Input: High-resolution Histopathology ROI (TUPAC16 Dataset).
2. Preprocessing: Normalization & stain-preserving augmentation.
3. Candidate Identification: SAHI slices the image -> YOLOv11 detects candidates -> Global Stitching & NMS.
4. Candidate Recognition: B-cos ResNet50 classifies crops & generates explanation maps.
5. Output: Final annotated image + "Smart Focus" interactive overlay.

## Performance Metrics
Our system achieves a competitive balance of sensitivity and specificity:

| Stage | Model | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stage 1 | YOLOv11L + SAHI | 0.82 | 0.74 | 0.78 |
| Stage 2 | B-cos ResNet50 | 0.94 | 0.83 | 0.88 |
| Pipeline | End-to-End | 0.94 | 0.62 | 0.75 |
